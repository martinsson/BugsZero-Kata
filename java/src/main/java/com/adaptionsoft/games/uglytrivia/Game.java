	/**
	 * It used to be possible to construct a game with less than two players and with more than six players
	 * however at runtime things did not work out. There was also no validation that the game was in a
	 * playable state. The user had to come up with the idea to call the isPlayable method.
	 *
	 * In this version it will not compile for anything other than 2-6 players. The Game class can only be
	 * instantiated it the correct way, and the user gets immediate feedback from the compiler on any
	 * usage errors.
	 *
	 * Granted this type of technique becomes awkward when the number of constructors grows big, in those
	 * cases we revert back to a more traditional strategy of runtime validations in the constructor.
