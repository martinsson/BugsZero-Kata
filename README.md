Bugs are optional, they sneak into our code much thanks the design choices we do, or fail to do. Let's 
try refactoring some existing code to make it more bug-repellent!

You'll practice reading code, looking for parts where it is likely that developers would create a bug if they extended the code. Whenever you've found such a weakness in the design your challenge is to strengthen the design in order to make that kind of bug very unlikely, or even impossible!

**First** Identify a bug or a weakness in the design. **Then** Explain what feature could cause a bug. Or how the design contributed to its introduction. This is important, simply saying another solution is better avoids thinking of why it is actually better.
**Finally** Explain or refactor the code to show the new design. 

Prefer small changes in the design, for instance before applying a design pattern try simpler things, like maybe ExtractConstant or replace conditional logic with a map/dictionnary.

## Bug Patterns
Have a look at the long list of common [bug-patterns](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata/blob/master/bug-patterns.md), mostly unnecessary weaknesses in design.
